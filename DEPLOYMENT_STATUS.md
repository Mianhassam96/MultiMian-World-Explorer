## 🔄 Automatic Deployments

After enabling GitHub Pages, every push to the `main` branch will automatically:
1. Trigger GitHub Actions workflow
2. Build the Next.js app
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Update your live site

No manual deployment needed after the initial setup!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check Actions Tab**
   - Go to Actions tab and click on the failed workflow
   - Read the error logs to identify the issue

2. **Common Issues**:
   - GitHub Pages not enabled → Enable it in Settings > Pages
   - Wrong source selected → Must be "GitHub Actions", not "Deploy from a branch"
   - Build errors → Check if `npm run build` works locally

3. **Verify Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
   If this fails locally, fix the errors before pushing

### If site doesn't load:

1. Wait 5 minutes (first deployment can be slow)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. Check if the Actions workflow completed successfully
